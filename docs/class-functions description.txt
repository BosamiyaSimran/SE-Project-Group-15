1. makeRequest in index.js - 

This function takes three parameters, namely method, url and data.
Method refers to the http method. For example - get, post, put, delete
Url refers to backend url which needs to opened in order to call api
Data refers to the data which will be passed to post/put api requests as body.

This function returns a javascript promise. In the promise, an XMLHttpRequest object is created. That object is used to open backend url and we are setting request header to application-json as we are sending json object as request body. Once we receive the api response, we return the translated text as a promise.
