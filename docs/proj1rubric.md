|-----|--------|---------|
|workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others...but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)|3|Evidence in GH  (https://github.com/BosamiyaSimran/SE-Project-Group-15/commits/main)|
| Number of commits|3|In GH (https://github.com/BosamiyaSimran/SE-Project-Group-15/commits/main)|

|Docs: doco generated , format not ugly |2|in GH|
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) |2| |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z|2|doc page entries|
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3| |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3 | |
| Use of version control tools| 3| |
|Use of  style checkers |3 |config files in GH showing your config| 
| Use of code  formatters. | 3|config files in GH showing your this formatter's  config|
| Use of syntax checkers| 3 |config files iin  GH showing this checker's config|
| Use of code coverage | 2|config files in GH|
| other automated analysis tools| 2|config files in GH|
| test cases exist|3|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the  code base|
| test cases are routinely executed|3 |e.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|
 | the files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3| |
| issues are discussed before they are closed| 3| even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|
| Chat channel: exists| 3| |
| test cases:.a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|2 |if a test case fails, open an issue and fix it|
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3| |
| evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3| |
| evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 3| |
